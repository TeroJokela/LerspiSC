# LerspiSC
LerspiSC is a simple screenshotting tool made in C++.

Once the program is initialized, it captures the entire screen and starts repainting it over and over again with tools to select an area from it.
When the user has selected an area an and released mouse1 (that needs to be held down to select the area) it gets uploaded to the server.

If you're going to use this yourself, make sure to add your server's IP for the client found in `Upload.h`.

For any problems or questions, feel free to ask.
